abstract: Cell instance segmentation, which identifies each specific cell area within
  a mi- croscope image, is helpful for cell analysis. Because of the high computational
  cost brought on by the large number of objects in the scene, mainstream instance
  segmentation techniques require much time and computational resources. In this paper,
  we proposed a two-stage method in which the first stage detects the bounding boxes
  of cells, and the second stage is segmentation in the detected bounding boxes. This
  method reduces inference time by more than 30% on images that image size is larger
  than 1024 pixels by 1024 pixels compared to the mainstream instance segmentation
  method while maintaining reasonable accuracy without using any external data.
