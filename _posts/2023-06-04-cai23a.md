abstract: Cell instance segmentation is a fundamental task in analyzing microscopy
  images, with applications in computer-aided biomedical research. In recent years,
  deep learning techniques have been widely used in this field. However, existing
  methods exhibit inadequate generalization ability towards multi-modal cellular images
  and require a considerable amount of manually labeled data for training. To overcome
  these limitations, we present VSM, a versatile semi-supervised model for multi-modal
  cell instance segmentation. Our method delivers high accuracy and efficiency, as
  verified through comprehensive experiments. Additionally, VSM achieved a top-five
  ranking in the Weakly Supervised Cell Segmentation category of the multi-modal High-Resolution
  Microscopy competition.
