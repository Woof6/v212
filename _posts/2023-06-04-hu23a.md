abstract: Cell Segmentation is an initial and fundamental step in biomedical image
  analysis, which strongly affects the experimental results of this analysis. Recently,
  deep learning based segmentation methods have shown great power in segmentation
  accuracy and efficiency. However, these data-driven methods still face many challenges,
  such as lack of annotations, multi-modality, and complex morphology, where morphological
  complexity significantly limits model performance. In this paper, we propose a new
  all-purpose framework with high morphological adaptability for multi-modality cell
  segmentation, termed Cell Segmenter (CS). For high convex cells with an arbitrary
  size, the Anchor-based Watershed Framework (AWF) precisely locates well-defined
  cell centers and generates segmentation based on these markers. For those elongated
  or non-convex cells, the center-independent segmentation method Omnipose is adopted
  to obtain satisfying masks. In the inference time, confidence-based quality estimation
  is conducted on the branch predictions if needed, and then the better result is
  chosen as the final segmentation. The F1-score of the proposed method reaches 0.8537
  on TuningSet and 0.6216 on the final test set of the NeurIPS 2022 Cell Segmentation
  Challenge.
