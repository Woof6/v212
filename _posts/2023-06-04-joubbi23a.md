abstract: Segmenting microscopy images is a crucial step for quantitatively analyzing
  biological imaging data. Classical tools for biological image segmentation need
  to be adjusted to the cell type and image conditions to get decent results. Another
  limitation is the lack of high-quality labeled data to train alternative methods
  like Deep Learning since manual labeling is costly and time-consuming. <em> Weakly
  Supervised Cell Segmentation in Multi-modality High-Resolution Microscopy Images
  </em> was organized by NeurIPS to solve this problem. The aim of the challenge was
  to develop a versatile method that can work with high variability, with few labeled
  images, a lot of unlabeled images, and with no human interaction. We developed CrossCT,
  a framework based on the cross–teaching between a CNN and a Transformer. The main
  idea behind this work was to improve the organizers’ baseline methods and use both
  labeled and unlabeled data. Experiments show that our method outperforms the baseline
  methods based on a supervised learning approach. We achieved an F1 score of 0.5988
  for the Transformer and 0.5626 for the CNN respecting the time limits imposed for
  inference.
