abstract: Cell segmentation is a fundamental task for computational biology analysis.
  Identifying the cell instances is often the first step in various downstream biomedical
  studies. However, many cell segmentation algorithms, including the recently emerging
  deep learning-based methods, still show limited generality under the multimodality
  environment. Weakly Supervised Cell Segmentation in Multi-modality High-Resolution
  Microscopy Images was hosted at NeurIPS 2022 to tackle this problem. We propose
  MEDIAR, a holistic pipeline for cell instance segmentation under multi-modality
  in this challenge. MEDIAR harmonizes data-centric and model-centric approaches as
  the learning and inference strategies, achieving a 0.9067 F1-score at the validation
  phase while satisfying the time budget. To facilitate subsequent research, we provide
  the source code and trained model as open-source.
