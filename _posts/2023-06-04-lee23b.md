abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant improvement in cell segmentation
  of microscopy images in the field of Biology. However, a lack of generalization
  has been a major bottleneck of segmentation models since the performance is largely
  degraded with out-of-distribution data or unseen class data. Developing a generalized
  segmentation model is challenging due to the diversity of modalities, different
  staining methods, complicated cell shapes, and extremely high image resolution in
  microscopy images. The dataset for the ‘’Weakly Supervised Cell Segmentation in
  Multi-modality High-Resolution Microscopy Images” challenge consists of images with
  these diverse characteristics. To address these challenges, we trained the Cellpose
  model to competently perform instance segmentation on datasets with various characteristics.
  For that, we 1) specified the model to only use green and blue channels for all
  types of cell images, and 2) investigated the effect and performance of the existing
  diameter estimation model to determine the areas where it performs best, using images
  of various resolutions. As a result, we achieved an F1 score of 0.7607 for the validation
  (Tuning) set.
