abstract: Cell segmentation for multi-modal microscopy images remains a challenge
  due to the complex textures, patterns, and cell shapes in these images. To tackle
  the problem, we first develop an automatic cell classification pipeline to label
  the microscopy images based on their low-level image characteristics, and then train
  a classification model based on the category labels. Afterward, we train a separate
  segmentation model for each category using the images in the corresponding category.
  Besides, we further deploy two types of segmentation models to segment cells with
  roundish and irregular shapes respectively. Moreover, an efficient and powerful
  backbone model is utilized to enhance the efficiency of our segmentation model.
  Evaluated on the Tuning Set of NeurIPS 2022 Cell Segmentation Challenge, our method
  achieves an F1-score of 0.8795 and the running time for all cases is within the
  time tolerance.
