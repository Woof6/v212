abstract: Cell segmentation is an important initial task in medical image analysis,
  and in recent years, data-driven deep learning methods have made groundbreaking
  achievements in this field. In this challenge, a multi-modal and partially labeled
  dataset is provided. In this paper, we propose a multi-modality cell segmentation
  framework called Re-Unet, which is based on the nnU-Net pipeline and an iterative
  self-training method. Re-Unet enriches the original data and fully considers the
  information of cell intervals while making full use of the semi-supervised data.
  Our proposed method achieves a mean F1 score of 0.6101 on the tuning set and a F1
  score of 0.4492 on the testing set.
