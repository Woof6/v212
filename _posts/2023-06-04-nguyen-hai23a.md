abstract: Cell segmentation is a fundamental task in biomedical image analysis, which
  involves the identification and separation of individual cells from microscopy images.
  Large-size images and unannotated data are two canailing problems degrading the
  performance in cell segmentation. Regarding these issues, we propose sliding window
  and pseudo-labeling techniques by conducting several experiments on different neural
  architectures. Following this approach, our method achieves a significant performance
  improvement and a final result of 0.8097 F1 score on the tuning set and 0.6379 F1
  score on the test set of Weakly Supervised Cell Segmentation in Multi-modality Microscopy
  challenge hosted at NeurIPS 2022.
