abstract: We present a simple framework for cell segmentation, based on uncertainty-aware
  Contour Proposal Networks (CPNs). It is designed to provide high segmentation accuracy
  while remaining computationally efficient, which makes it an ideal solution for
  high throughput microscopy applications. Each predicted cell is provided with four
  uncertainty estimations that give information about the localization accuracy of
  the detected cell boundaries. Such additional insights are valuable for downstream
  single-cell analysis in microscopy image-based biology and biomedical research.
  In the context of the NeurIPS 22 Cell Segmentation Challenge, the proposed solution
  is shown to generalize well in a multi-modality setting, while respecting domain-specific
  requirements such as focusing on specific cell types. Without an ensemble or test-time
  augmentation the method achieves an F1 score of 0.8986 on the challenge’s validation
  set.
