abstract: Many clinical and biological tasks depend on accurate cell instance segmentation.
  Currently, the rapid development of deep learning realizes the automation of cell
  segmentation, which significantly decreases the workload of clinicians and researchers.
  However, most existing cell segmentation frameworks are fully supervised and modality-specific.
  Towards this end, this paper proposes a semi-supervised cell instance segmentation
  framework for multi-modality microscope images. Firstly, $K$-Means clustering is
  utilized to discriminate the image modality. Then, for phase contrast and differential
  interference contrast images, Cellpose is adopted. For brightfield images, we subdivide
  them into two sub-categories according to the cell diameter by $K$-Means and optimize
  a U-Net for the large diameter group. For fluorescence images, we propose a semi-supervised
  learning strategy using CDNet. The leaderboard shows that our proposed framework
  reaches an F1 score of 0.8428 on the tuning set, which ranks 6th among all teams.
