abstract: 'Automatic cell segmentation enjoys great popularity with the development
  of deep learning. However, existing methods tend to focus on the binary segmentation
  between foreground and background in a single domain, but fail to generalize to
  multi-modality cell images and to exploit numerous valuable unlabeled data. To mitigate
  these limitations, we propose a Modality-aware Anti-ambiguity UNet (MAUNet) in a
  unified deep model via an encoder-decoder structure for robust cell segmentation.
  The proposed MAUNet model enjoys several merits. First, the proposed instance-aware
  decode endows pixel features with better cell boundary discrimination capabilities
  benefiting from cell-wise distance field. And the ambiguity-aware decode aims at
  alleviating the domain gap caused by multimodality cell images credited to a customized
  anti-ambiguity proxy for domaininvariant learning. Second, we prepend the consistency
  regularization to enable exploration of unlabeled images, and a novel post-processing
  strategy to incorporate morphology prior to cell instance segmentation. Experimental
  results on the official validation set demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. '
