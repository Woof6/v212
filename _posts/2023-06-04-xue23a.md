abstract: Instance segmentation of multi-modality high-resolution microscopy images
  is an important task in computational pathology. We extended HoVer-Net[1], originally
  developed for segmentation and classification of nuclei in multi-Tissue histology
  images, to apply it under weakly supervised situation. According to the final tests,
  this modification also works for multi-modality microscopy.
