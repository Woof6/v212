abstract: Cell segmentation is one of the most fundamental tasks in the areas of medical
  image analysis, which assists in cell recognition and number counting. The seg-
  mentation results obtained will be poor due to the diverse cell morphology and the
  frequent presence of impurities in the cell pictures. In order to solve the cell
  segmentation which are from a competition held by Neural Information Processing
  Systems(NIPS), we present a network that combines attention gates with U-Net++ to
  segment varied sizes of cells. Using the feature filtering of the attention gate
  can adjust the convolution block’s output, so as to improve the segmentation effect.
  The F1 score of our method reached 0.5874, Rank Running Time get 2.5431 seconds.
