abstract: Cell segmentation is significant for downstream single-cell analysis in
  biological and biomedical research. Recently, image segmentation methods based on
  supervised learning have achieved promising results. However, most of them rely
  on intensive manual annotations, which are extremely time-consuming and expensive
  for cell segmentation. In addition, existing methods are often trained for a specific
  modality with poor generalization ability. In this paper, a novel semi-supervised
  cell segmentation method is proposed to segment microscopy images from multiple
  modalities. Specifically, Mean Teacher model is introduced to a multi-task learning
  framework, named Multi-task Mean Teacher (MT$^{2}$), in which both the classification
  and the regression heads are utilized to improve the prediction performance. Moreover,
  new data augmentation and multi-scale inference strategies are presented to enhance
  the robustness and generalization ability. For the quantitative evaluation on the
  Tuning Set of NeurIPS 2022 Cell Segmentation Competition, our method achieves the
  F1 Score of 0.8690, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised
  learning method. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/djh-dzxw/MT2}
